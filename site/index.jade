  h2 Theory
  p The purpose of this experiment is to determine the curvature of the earth solely
    | by mechanical measurement.
    | A neutrally buoyant fishing line should form a perfectly straight
    | line when held under high tension in a long stretch of still water. If
    | each end is at depth `Y` beneath the water surface `S`
    | and we measure the depth `Y + DeltaY` at the line's mid-point, then:
  ul
    li `DeltaY` > 0 implies convexity of `S`
    li `DeltaY` < 0 implies concavity of `S`
    li `DeltaY` = 0 implies flatness of `S`
